# KS2.Drive
This software allows you to mount a webDAV / AOS server as if it was a local HDD.<br/>

It is similar to what webdrive© or netdrive© do.

The software is intented to be used in conjunction with Alfresco ECM (and tested as such) but should work with any webDAV server.
As every WebDAV implementation is different, should you encounter an issue with a specific webDAV server, please report here.

Usage :
-	Download the setup program for KS² Drive (https://github.com/KS2-FR/KS2.Drive/releases)
-	Run KS2Drive.exe
-	Configure the server :<br/>
  ->	Enter the Webdav/AOS URL of the server<br/>
  ->	Select the protocol (Webdav or AOS)<br/>
  ->	Enter your credentials<br/>
-	Hit "SAVE"
-	Right-click on the icon loaded in the notification area and select "MOUNT"

Note :
AOS is a kind of webDav protocol implemented in Alfresco ECM (http://docs.alfresco.com/5.0/concepts/aos-intro.html)
